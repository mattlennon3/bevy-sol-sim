Something like "Escape Speed" xkcd (2d), but with space engineers multiplayer and real gravity
https://xkcd.com/2765/

Voxel based
- Planets have a circular voxel system, with a planet core which you either can't dig through (not fun), or can remove entirely to build a base!
  - The core fixes the issue of a planet center making the voxels too squished.
- Try to preserve all material when collisions happen
- Planets need to be big enough to build a base
- Automation of processing materials
- No crafting, just build blueprints and you have robots which do it for you
  - Or a gun which crafts it after you place the blueprint
- Progressive map/radar depending on your communication tech
- You can claim machines or devices if you deactivate/disable them (like space engineers)
- Different rock types and materials
- Planets desolate of life at the start, keeps things simpler. 

Slow planet orbit, takes on average 5h to orbit the sun
Water will turn to ice and clouds depending on how close you are to the sun
  Try making an elliptical orbit planet with this feature!

You are maybe some kind of robot, a bit like Dyson Sphere Program

Fairly limited set of elements (block types) for planets, to keep it simple. Water (fuel, crafting mats), iron, clay, granite

Water can be liquid, and act like a liquid in this voxel space when in this form
Will freeze over when the planet drops below 0C (calculated by distance from sun)

Mining goes like this:
- You have a heavy tool that can easily cut through clay
- But, you need to place a "dump" location first.
- You start lasering your clay and little bots come and start mining it
  -  As a game quirk, they can actually hold unlimited clay providing you are mining
  - But as soon as you let go, which might be likely if in combat or lots is happening...
    - The robots go to the dump marker, where you set the dump direction, e.g what direction they fling it in
    Then fire it all out at a high flow rate
    - if it clogs, disable the tool
    you can place another dump marker for free, but with the condition that the previous marker
    still exists and contains all the material to dump, and will do if the direction frees up
- clay is affected by gravity when marked as "loose"
- clay can also be compacted
- granite can be mined, but it takes longer
- there is iron to be mined, has it's own dumping marker

Launching goes like this:
- shows a percentage of the speed required to orbit
- launch shows your projected trajectory ahead, will make a circle when you get to orbit

I would like "silos" to be possible
as rocket launch sites that aren't exposed to space

Space debris will be a real danger in this game

Underground living may be preferable to overground
Though there could be a concrete material which is worth using to absorb most v small meterorites
Perhaps an automated laser defence could be cool

Nuclear power is possible and will be a very cheap, long lasting way to get power

A planetary colission is possible and will be simulated as best as suits the game, but all voxels are preserved
The mass of the system never changes, perhaps the number of voxels might, ideally won't change though!
